            <p>
              Personal finance should be accessible, simple, and empowering. Too many budgeting apps today are bloated, expensive, or overcomplicated. We built the isitbudgettime Suite to offer clear, fast, effective tools that anyone â€” from students to retirees â€” can use immediately without friction or fear of privacy invasion.
